/*
	In order to utilize Polymorphism, we need to use pointers.
	The main idea is that we can do pointers of base classes
	that point to derived classes. These pointers don't have
	to be dynamically allocated pointers but they still have 
	to be pointers. So you can also do something like:
		const Dog buster;
		const Animal* dog = &buster;
	But you see, when you create an instance of a derived class
	and assign it to a base class pointer. These pointers would
	only work with base class functions but with derived class 
	functions, it would only work with the derived class functions
	that have been overridden! So if the Cat class has a unique
	function called doPurring(), a const Animal* cat = new Cat()
	would NOT be able to call cat.doPurring().

	In addition to that, if we have a function that is available
	in the base class but we want to reuse it to do different things
	in derived classes, like the function makeSound(), then we have
	to override this function. The way to do so is to use the 'virtual' 
	keyword in the class defintion of the Animal class before the
	function makeSound(). If we do not do so, then the compiler would
	always assume you want the default makeSound() function of the Animal
	base class. That is because a redefined function like makeSound() is
	bound at compile time. It is set in stone, its binding is static.

	So since our pointer is of type Animal when we say something like
	const Animal* cat =  new Cat(); then the compiler is to going to
	choose the Animal's definition of that function at COMPILE TIME. So by
	using the virtual keyword, the type of binding changes from static to
	dynamic and so, the decision as to which makeSound() function to use 
	is now made at RUN TIME. So basically, when a function is declared as
	virtual in a base class, C++ uses a virtual table (vtable) to determine
	which function to call at runtime, allowing the derived class's 
	implementation to be executed.

	NOTE: This also applies to the destructors! If you do not use the virtual
	keyword with the destructor of Animal, it will always call the Animal's
	destructor (when you're working with base class pointers assigned to derived
	class instances), even if you had separate destructors for your derived 
	classes. So basically, if you had anything malloced within your derived 
	classes, those would leak. So to fix that issue, use the virtual keyword 
	with your base class destructor so that the derived class destructors are
	explicility called when you exit the program or when you free their
	memories.
